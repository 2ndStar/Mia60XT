# Mia60XT
This repository has the production files for the Mia60XT keyboard. It is a 60% (Fixed JIS Layout) + XT Column with Topre switches.
It has all the necessary files for one to create a copy for personal use.

##  Disclaimer
- **PCB Files**: 
  - Not perfect! It works but needs to be bandaid fixed with Vial. I have no desire to fix the wiring issue but you're welcome to tinker with my rendition or make your own PCB.
  - I have absolutely no knowledge on how EC PCBs work. It is an (almost) 1 for 1 copy of [Cipulot's EC60](https://github.com/Cipulot/EC60). 
  - All credits go to [Cipulot](https://github.com/Cipulot) for making the EC60 open source.

## PCB
### Note
- The project was initialy named **Faen** and the layout was to be 65% + XT. Ignore the naming of the PCB files.
- The Layout is fixed

### Plate
- **Thickness**: 1.2mm
- **Material**: Metal - Something that can be tapped
  - I used Mild Steel because it's cheap on SendCutSend
- Self-tapped using a M2 tap head
  - SendCutSend also offers tapping service but might not for 1.2mm Mild Steel
- **Plate screws**:
  - x34 8mm M2 
  - Screw directly from backside of PCB and into the plate
### Mounting Style
- Gummy O-ring under the plate
  - Size: Large (70-75%)
  - Hardness: W/E you want

- Thin foam strip underside of Top Case
  - Prevents metal-metal contact between plate and underside of top case
