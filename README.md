# Mia60XT
This repository has the production files for the Mia60XT keyboard. It is a 60% (Fixed JIS Layout) + XT Column with Topre switches.
It has all the necessary files for one to create a copy for personal use.

##  Disclaimer
- **PCB Files**: 
  - Not perfect! It works but needs to be bandaid fixed with Vial. I have no desire to fix the wiring issue but you're welcome to tinker with the PCB on your own.
  - I have no knowledge on how EC PCBs work. It is an (almost) 1 for 1 copy of [Cipulot's EC60](https://github.com/Cipulot/EC60). All credits go the [Cipulot](https://github.com/Cipulot)

## PCB
### Note
- The project was initialy named **Faen** and the layout was to be 65% + XT. Ignore the naming of the PCB files.
- The Layout is fixed
